# `deploy/margo/` — iaiops as a Margo edge-application (skeleton)

> **Status: packaged + signed, but NOT Margo-compliant yet.** iaiops ships as a [Margo](https://margo.org/)-style
> edge application: per-profile signed OCI images on GHCR + a cosign-signed application package on
> each GitHub release, descriptor built to the `margo.org/v1-alpha1` schema. A passing
> conformance-toolkit result is still `待核实` — see
> [`../../docs/MARGO-ALIGNMENT.md`](../../docs/MARGO-ALIGNMENT.md) for the full plan and honesty note.
> No material claims *Margo-compliant* until the conformance result exists.

## What's here

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Dockerfile` | Reproducible, **non-root**, read-only-rootfs-friendly image. Installs the published `iaiops[<profile>]` wheel; headless MCP entrypoint. Build-arg `PROFILE` = edition. |
| `compose.yaml` | Example hardened run for **local dev** (builds from source): `read_only`, `cap_drop: ALL`, no-new-privileges, single **token-authenticated** MCP port (optional IP allowlist) (socket transport — no OT inbound), single config/secret volume. |
| `package.compose.yaml` | **Deploy-ready** compose shipped inside the signed application package (as `compose.yaml`): references the published, version-pinned GHCR image (`profile` parameter selects the per-edition variant), same hardened posture, no build section. |
| `margo.yaml` | Margo **ApplicationDescription**, built to the real **`margo.org/v1-alpha1`** schema (docs.margo.org, PR1 pre-draft): compose `deploymentProfiles` / `components` / `requiredResources` / `parameters` / `configuration`. `packageLocation`/`keyLocation` point at the signed release asset + `cosign.pub`. Remaining `待核实` = only the secret-parameter flag pending [`margo/specification#145`](https://github.com/margo/specification/issues/145). |
| `cosign.pub` | Public verify key for the signed images and the application package (private key lives only in CI secrets — rotate by regenerating the pair + updating this file). |
| `.dockerignore` | Keeps the build context tiny (image installs from PyPI). |

## Published artifacts (per release, built by `.github/workflows/publish-image.yml`)

- `ghcr.io/industrial-aiops/iaiops:<version>-<profile>` — multi-arch (amd64/arm64), cosign-signed.
  Verify: `cosign verify --key deploy/margo/cosign.pub ghcr.io/industrial-aiops/iaiops:<version>-<profile>`
- `iaiops-margo-package-<version>.tar.gz` (+ `.sig`) on the GitHub release — the Margo application
  package: `margo.yaml` + deploy-ready `compose.yaml` + `cosign.pub`.
  Verify: `cosign verify-blob --key cosign.pub --signature <pkg>.tar.gz.sig <pkg>.tar.gz`
- CI waits for the wheel to appear on PyPI before building (the tag→PyPI race silently broke the
  v0.12–v0.14 image builds), and `tests/test_margo_package.py` lints descriptor ↔ profile menu ↔
  pip extras ↔ build matrix ↔ version pins on every CI run.

## Quick start

```bash
# Build the factory-edition image (fab | factory | process | building | water)
docker build -t iaiops:factory --build-arg PROFILE=factory -f deploy/margo/Dockerfile .

# First-time setup writes into the state volume (encrypts credentials)
docker compose -f deploy/margo/compose.yaml run --rm iaiops iaiops init
docker compose -f deploy/margo/compose.yaml run --rm iaiops iaiops doctor

# Run the headless MCP server (factory profile)
docker compose -f deploy/margo/compose.yaml up
```

## Transport: stdio vs socket

The image speaks MCP over **stdio** by default (fine for a local `docker run … | client` pipe). A
Margo/edge deployment fronts it as a **socket** instead — the shape the app-package WG recommends
(one container port, no protocol glue). Select it with three env vars (already set in `compose.yaml`):

```bash
IAIOPS_MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http   # or: sse
IAIOPS_MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0                 # bind inside the container
IAIOPS_MCP_PORT=8000                    # the one inbound MCP tool port (not an OT port)
IAIOPS_MCP_TOKEN=<openssl rand -base64 48>  # REQUIRED off loopback: 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
IAIOPS_ALLOWLIST_IPS=10.0.0.0/24        # optional: who may call it (403 otherwise) — the orchestrator, never 127.0.0.1/32
```

A socket bound to anything but loopback **refuses to start without a token** (or
`IAIOPS_MCP_TOKEN_FILE` pointing at a mounted secret — preferred, the value then never shows in
`docker inspect`). Off loopback the SDK's loopback-only Host check is replaced: list accepted Host
headers in `IAIOPS_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (e.g. `iaiops:*,10.0.0.5:8000`), or leave it unset and rely
on the token. Margo leaves workload-to-workload
authentication to the application, so iaiops does it; the IP allowlist is a second layer, not the
authentication.

The OT side stays strictly **outbound** to the endpoints in `config.yaml`; the socket port is only
the tool interface for the orchestrator/agent.

## Why this is a good Margo citizen (already)

- **Non-root, read-only rootfs, outbound-only to OT** — the single inbound port is the token-
  authenticated MCP tool interface (optional IP allowlist), not an OT listener.
- **Governed by construction** — audit / budget / risk-tier / undo + MOC gating wrap every tool.
- **Air-gap friendly** — pure-Python, offline wheelhouse install, encrypted local secrets, optional
  on-box LLM brain (data never leaves the plant).

## WG questions — answered (app-package-definition-wg, 2026-07-13, ABB / P. Presson)

The three open questions posted to the WG ([Discourse t/43](https://discourse.margo.org/t/governed-mcp-based-ot-diagnostics-as-a-margo-edge-application-reference-feedback/43)) were answered:

1. **MCP transport** — *out of Margo's scope*; socket recommended for deployment simplicity. → this
   skeleton now defaults the deployment to the **streamable-http socket** transport (above).
2. **Profiles** — *either idiom is valid.* → we keep **one parameterised application** (the `profile`
   parameter), not N packages.
3. **Secrets / least-privilege** — *no secret-typed parameter in the spec yet*, tracked at
   [`margo/specification#145`](https://github.com/margo/specification/issues/145). → `masterPassword`
   is modeled as a **reference** (empty in the descriptor, injected from the device secret facility);
   iaiops resolves every credential from its on-box encrypted store **by name**, so secret values
   never travel in the descriptor or deployment spec. We'll contribute this reference-model as a use
   case on #145.

Full detail + the contribution plan: appendix B of [`../../docs/MARGO-ALIGNMENT.md`](../../docs/MARGO-ALIGNMENT.md).
The remaining `待核实` are only the secret-parameter flag (#145) and the conformance run.
